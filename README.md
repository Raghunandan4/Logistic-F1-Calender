# Logistic-F1-Calender
A fun Python project to create an Efficient F1 calender

### Logistics of an F1 calender :~
- Before the chequered flag has fallen on Sunday’s Grand Prix, the pack-up operation is already underway to move F1 onto its next location. Some spare parts, such as engines can be packed up ready for transit as early as Saturday
- The wider tear-down plan is intricately set out on the Thursday morning before each race weekend begins. It’s not uncommon for circuits to be completely cleared of F1’s presence in as little as eight hours after the Grand Prix ends.
  - If two races are separated by two weeks, there’s a window of ten days for travel and transit.
  - If it’s a back-to-back race weekend, the time available to get everything operational at the next venue between back-to-back races is just three days.
  - Double headers which involve road travel across Europe can be some of the tightest turnarounds of the year.

### This Project :~
This Logistic/ Optimal F1 calender has been programmed for the 2023 season, with all the 23 races (coughs in Imola.... iykyk). 

Used coordinates (latitude, longitude) for the most approximate location of the circuits. Checks distance between 2 venues and adjusts the calender to reduce travel time and logistic costs.
